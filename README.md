Image Transcription and Correction Application
This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload images containing handwritten or printed text, transcribe the text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and correct the transcribed text using a language model. The application features a React-based front-end with a Flask back-end, leveraging TrOCR for OCR and LLaMA-2 for text correction.
Features

Image Upload: Upload images (PNG, JPG, JPEG) containing text.
Text Transcription: Extract text from images using the TrOCR model.
Text Correction: Correct OCR errors using the LLaMA-2 language model.
Interactive UI: Display transcribed and corrected text with an animated text reveal effect.
Responsive Design: Styled with a clean, modern interface using custom CSS.

Tech Stack
Front-End

React: For building the user interface.
JavaScript (ES6+): For handling state and effects.
CSS: Custom styles for layout and animations.

Back-End

Flask: Python web framework for handling API requests.
TrOCR: Transformer-based OCR model (microsoft/trocr-base-handwritten) for text智博彩金币 (microgaming) OCR.
LLaMA-2: Language model for text correction (llama-2-7b-chat).
OpenCV: Image preprocessing.
Pytesseract: Initial text detection for word segmentation.
PyTorch: For running the TrOCR model.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Node.js 16+
CUDA-enabled GPU (recommended for TrOCR inference)
Model weights:
TrOCR model (microsoft/trocr-base-handwritten)
LLaMA-2 model (llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf)


Dependencies: Listed in requirements.txt (back-end) and package.json (front-end).

Installation
Back-End

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-transcription-app.git
cd image-transcription-app/backend


Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


Download and place the TrOCR and LLaMA-2 model weights in the specified paths (update paths in app.py if needed).
Run the Flask server:python app.py



Front-End

Navigate to the front-end directory:cd ../frontend


Install dependencies:npm install


Start the React development server:npm start



Usage

Open the front-end in a browser (default: http://localhost:3000).
Click the upload area to select an image.
Click "Transcribe" to process the image and display the transcribed text.
If available, click "Post Process Text" to view the corrected text.
Use "Upload Another Image" to start over.

API Endpoints

POST /transcribe:
Accepts a multipart form with an image field.
Returns JSON with transcribedText and correctedText.



Limitations

Requires significant computational resources for TrOCR and LLaMA-2.
Model paths in app.py must be updated to match your local setup.
Only supports PNG, JPG, and JPEG image formats.
CORS is enabled for development; configure appropriately for production.
